- 👋 Hi, I’m @bizzbusy
- 👀 I’m interested in running the function live() inside software that will attribute to in-game living sequence for models acting natural.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning function live() in my own living sequence while studying updates to my live code repository brain().
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on sequencing live() and brain(), maybe even with your brain().
- 📫 How to reach me? You will be the 1st to know() when I find myself(props).
